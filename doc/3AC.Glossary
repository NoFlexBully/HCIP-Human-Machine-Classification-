# Three Asymmetric Consequence (3AC) — Glossary

## Core Structures

**S₀**  
Initial high‑density state containing three asymmetry layers.

**S₀¹, S₀², S₀³**  
Substates representing distinct asymmetry layers.

**TRᵢ (Temporal Remnant)**  
Residual “hot” fragment of \(S_0^i\) that resists reinterpretation and can be reactivated.

**Vᵢ(t)**  
Semantic potential function for layer i.

**∇Vᵢ(t)**  
Gradient of semantic potential.

**wᵢ**  
Weight for layer i (emotional intensity, interpretive inertia).

**∇V_total(t)**  
Sum of semantic potential gradients.

**∇Ṽ_total(t)**  
Weighted sum of semantic potential gradients.


## Activation & Environment

**κ (kappa)**  
Catalyst influence — stabilizing factors.

**L (linearity)**  
Environmental linearity — predictability and stability.

**cues(t)**  
Time‑varying triggers that activate remnants.

**Aᵢ(t)**  
Activation level of remnant \(TR_i\).

**ΔVᵢ(t)**  
Spike in semantic potential from layer i.

**ΞT (Xi T)**  
Emergent tension — accumulated pressure.

**Tₛ (Temporal Shear)**  
Tension between fading and forming structures.


## Identity Dynamics

**Σₑ (Sigma e)**  
Synthesis event — collapse of tension into new structure.

**D(t) (Drift)**  
Slow, cumulative change in meaning.

**M(t) (Mirror Entanglement)**  
Mirror channel that copies tension and applies it to drift.

**L(t) (Recursive Light)**  
Reflective capacity; may implode or become inaccessible.

**S₀.₅**  
Intermediate partial‑pivot state.

**S₁**  
New identity topology after synthesis.

**S₁(stable)**  
Identity after surviving stress tests.


## Fixed‑Point Operators

**Fᵢ(A\*, S₀ᵢ)**  
Forward‑projected reinterpretation of layer i.

**Rᵢ(A\*, S₀ᵢ)**  
Retroactive reinterpretation of layer i.

**3AC (Three Asymmetric Consequence)**  
A configuration where three asymmetry layers interact through remnants, potentials, activations, and synthesis, producing a vectorized fixed‑point condition.
