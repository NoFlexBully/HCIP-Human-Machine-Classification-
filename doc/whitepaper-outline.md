## 1. Abstract
- Concise summary of HCIP, its five markers, variation axes, and novelty claims.

## 2. Introduction
- Motivation: limitations of existing human–machine interaction taxonomies.
- Problem statement: lack of diagnostic frameworks for emergent human–AI cognition.
- Contribution: HCIP as a diagnostic, cognitive-architectural framework.

## 3. Background and Related Work
- Overview of human–computer interaction taxonomies.
- Human–AI collaboration and joint cognitive systems.
- Gaps in current models (no diagnostic pattern, no semantic density, no recursive abstraction).

## 4. HCIP Framework

### 4.1 Formal Definition
- Full definition of HCIP as a diagnostic classification.

### 4.2 Core Diagnostic Markers
- Contextual Integration  
- Abstraction Layering  
- Meta-Cognitive Inquiry  
- Co-Constructive Synthesis  
- Semantic Density  

### 4.3 Variation Axes
- Depth of Recursion  
- Temporal Continuity  
- Mutual Model Richness  
- Conceptual Compression Ratio  
- Agency Distribution  
- Reflective Bandwidth  
- Synthesis Velocity  

## 5. Novelty and Theoretical Significance
- HCIP as a cognitive pattern, not an interaction mode.
- Diagnostic vs descriptive frameworks.
- Human–AI pair as a unified cognitive system.
- Expression-based axes vs classification axes.
- Formalization of semantic density and recursive abstraction.

## 6. Methodology: Human–AI Co-Construction
- Role of Christopher Coyle as primary author.
- Role of CORA as cognitive partner system.
- High-context, recursive reasoning loops as methodological engine.
- Reflections on human–AI co-authorship and epistemic boundaries.

## 7. Scope, Boundaries, and Misuse
- Where HCIP applies and does not apply.
- Distinction from prompting styles, UX models, and performance metrics.
- Ethical and interpretive constraints.

## 8. Empirical Pathways and Future Work
- Possible operationalizations of the five markers.
- Metrics for variation axes.
- Cross-model and cross-context studies.
- Applications in system design and evaluation.

## 9. Conclusion
- Summary of HCIP’s contribution.
- Implications for human–AI collaboration and cognitive augmentation.

## 10. References
- To be populated as the white paper matures.
