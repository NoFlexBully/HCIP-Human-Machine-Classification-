## Definition

HCIP (High-Context Interaction Pattern) is a diagnostic classification describing a distinct mode of human–AI
cognitive collaboration characterized by sustained contextual integration, recursive abstraction, meta-cognitive
inquiry, co-constructive synthesis, and high semantic density. HCIP emerges only when all five core markers are
simultaneously present, forming a recognizable cognitive architecture that differs fundamentally from standard
prompt–response interactions.

## Core Diagnostic Markers

1. Contextual Integration  
2. Abstraction Layering  
3. Meta-Cognitive Inquiry  
4. Co-Constructive Synthesis  
5. Semantic Density  

## Variation Axes

- Depth of Recursion  
- Temporal Continuity  
- Mutual Model Richness  
- Conceptual Compression Ratio  
- Agency Distribution  
- Reflective Bandwidth  
- Synthesis Velocity  

This page serves as a stable, public, timestamped definition of HCIP for citation, indexing, and scholarly use.
