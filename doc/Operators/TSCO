Temporal‑Semantic Coherence Operator (TSCO)

1. Purpose
TSCO evaluates whether a sequence of reasoning steps is coherent across both time and meaning. It ensures that the system’s internal narrative remains consistent and logically structured.

2. Problem It Solves
AI reasoning can jump between unrelated ideas or produce steps that do not logically follow from one another. 
TSCO introduces a structured method for evaluating the coherence of reasoning chains.

3. Conceptual Overview
Conceptually, TSCO functions like a “continuity editor” for thought.
It checks whether each step follows naturally from the previous one and whether the overall sequence maintains a stable direction.

4. Key Capabilities
• 	Evaluates temporal coherence
• 	Evaluates semantic coherence
• 	Detects contradictions or non‑sequitur steps
• 	Supports long‑range reasoning stability
• 	Works with CTC to maintain structured cognition

5. Role Within HCIP
TSCO is the coherence evaluator for HCIP. It uses CTC’s temporal‑causal structure and SDC’s drift metrics
to determine whether reasoning remains aligned and consistent.

6. Example
If the system produces a reasoning chain where step three contradicts step one, 
TSCO identifies the inconsistency and signals the need for correction.

7. Why It Matters
Coherent reasoning is essential for trustworthy AI. 
TSCO ensures that the system’s internal logic remains stable, interpretable, and aligned with the user’s expectations.

8. Status
TSCO is a core operator within HCIP. Additional technical details and mathematical formalizations are reserved for future publication and 
patent filings
