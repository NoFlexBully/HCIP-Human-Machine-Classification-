Semantic Drift Comparator (SDC)
1. Purpose
SDC provides a structured method for measuring how far the system’s current reasoning has moved from the user’s intended direction.
It quantifies drift and helps maintain stable, aligned cognition.

2. Problem It Solves
AI systems can gradually shift away from the user’s goals or context without noticing. 
This drift can accumulate and lead to misinterpretation, hallucination, or loss of coherence.
SDC introduces a formal mechanism for detecting and correcting this shift.

3. Conceptual Overview
Conceptually, SDC functions like a “compass” for reasoning.
It compares the system’s current trajectory with the user’s original intent and flags deviations.
It can also track the rate of drift over time.

4. Key Capabilities
- Measures semantic drift across reasoning steps
- Detects accelerating or compounding misalignment
- Supports operator‑level correction
- Provides signals to ROSE and TSCO
- Helps maintain long‑range coherence

5. Role Within HCIP
SDC is the primary drift‑detection mechanism in HCIP. 
It informs ROSE when emergent operators may be misaligned and supports TSCO in evaluating temporal‑semantic coherence.

6. Example
If the user asks about a technical concept and the system begins drifting into unrelated topics,
SDC detects the divergence and signals the need for correction.

7. Why It Matters
Drift is one of the most common failure modes in AI reasoning.
SDC provides a structured way to detect and mitigate it, ensuring that the system remains aligned with the user’s goals.

8. Status
SDC is part of the core HCIP reasoning pipeline.
