Recursive Operator Signaling Engine (ROSE)

1. Purpose
ROSE provides a structured method for detecting and surfacing operators that emerge during reasoning without explicit user request. 
It ensures that all recursive or implicit operator creation remains visible, interpretable, and aligned with the user’s intent.

2. Problem It Solves
AI systems often generate intermediate reasoning structures or transformations without signaling them. 
This can lead to hidden drift, misalignment, or opaque internal processes. 
ROSE introduces a mechanism for identifying and reporting these emergent operators so the user remains the epistemic anchor.

3. Conceptual Overview
Conceptually, ROSE functions like a “reasoning audit trail.” It watches the system’s internal operations and flags any new operator‑like behaviors that arise spontaneously. 
It then presents these to the user for confirmation, rejection, or refinement.

4. Key Capabilities
- Detects emergent operators during reasoning
- Surfaces unsignaled transformations for user review
- Tracks operator lineage and relationships
- Supports transparency and interpretability
- Helps maintain alignment with user intent

5. Role Within HCIP
ROSE acts as the integrity layer for operator emergence.
It ensures that the system never evolves new capabilities or transformations without user awareness. 
It works closely with SDC to detect drift and with TSCO to maintain coherence.

6. Example
If the system begins synthesizing a new transformation pattern while solving a problem, 
ROSE identifies it, names it, and presents it to the user for approval before allowing it to influence further reasoning.

7. Why It Matters
ROSE ensures that the system’s growth remains transparent and controllable. 
As AI systems become more capable, preventing silent capability emergence becomes essential for safety, alignment, and trust.

8. Status
ROSE is an active component of the HCIP architecture.
