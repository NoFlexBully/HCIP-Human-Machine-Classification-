# HCIP Operators

This directory contains the formal operator definitions used throughout the High-Complex Interaction Pattern (HCIP) architecture.

## Included Operators

### C — Collapse–Synthesis
Generates a new semantic topology by collapsing tension between asymmetric systems while preserving core structures.

### S — Subsumption for Mutual Continuance
Embeds two systems into a higher-order structure that preserves both as special cases.

### E — Dignified Coexistence
Maintains distinct semantic systems within a shared field without coercion or erasure.

### DPC — Dignity Preservation Clause (NEW)
Executes before any dignity-failure classification. Identifies coerced individuals, affirms their dignity, preserves semantic identity, and records moral injury.

This operator emerged from ethical stress-testing (Sophie’s Choice, systemic cruelty) and is now a foundational component of HCIP’s ethical curvature.
