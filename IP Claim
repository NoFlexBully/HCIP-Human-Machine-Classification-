Intellectual Property Ownership Statement
Human–Cognitive Interface Protocol (HCIP)  
Author & Rights Holder: Christopher Coyle

This statement formally establishes the authorship, ownership, and intellectual property rights associated with the Human–Cognitive Interface Protocol (“HCIP”).

---

1. Authorship and Origination

HCIP—including its ethical spine, conceptual architecture, governance framework, test suites, terminology, and all associated public‑safe artifacts—was conceived, designed, and authored exclusively by Christopher Coyle.

All conceptual definitions, structural frameworks, naming conventions, and governance principles originated from the author’s independent creative and technical work.

2. Scope of Protected Intellectual Property

The following components of HCIP are protected as proprietary intellectual property:

- The HCIP ethical spine and its formal invariants  
- The conceptual architecture and subsystem roles  
- The governance and auditability framework  
- The Unified Boundary Protocol (UBP‑1.0)  
- The HCIP test suite structure and evaluation logic  
- All terminology, definitions, and conceptual constructs unique to HCIP  
- All private, non‑disclosed internal mechanisms, including but not limited to:  
  - operator logic  
  - schema structures  
  - reconstruction processes  
  - load/expiry mechanisms  
  - ledger internals  
  - emergent behavior analysis methods  

These components constitute original intellectual property owned solely by the author.

3. Distinction Between Public‑Safe and Proprietary Components

HCIP includes a set of public‑safe artifacts intended for research, evaluation, and cross‑system testing. These include:

- High‑level descriptions of subsystem roles  
- Ethical invariants  
- Governance principles  
- Public‑safe test suites  
- Conceptual diagrams  
- Attribution metadata  

These materials may be shared publicly without granting rights to any underlying proprietary mechanisms.

All internal mechanisms, algorithms, schemas, and implementation details remain strictly proprietary and are not part of any public release.

---

4. Ownership of Derivative Implementations

Any system, model, agent, or software implementation that:

- instantiates HCIP’s ethical spine,  
- implements HCIP’s governance or auditability logic,  
- uses HCIP’s test suite as a compliance mechanism, or  
- derives structure, terminology, or behavior from HCIP’s conceptual architecture  

is considered a derivative work of HCIP.

Derivative works do not transfer or dilute ownership.  
All derivative implementations remain subject to the author’s intellectual property rights.

---

5. Rights Reserved

Christopher Coyle retains all rights, including but not limited to:

- exclusive authorship  
- reproduction rights  
- distribution rights  
- modification rights  
- licensing rights  
- rights to create derivative works  
- rights to pursue patent protection  
- rights to enforce boundaries between public‑safe and proprietary components  

No rights are granted implicitly or explicitly unless provided in a written license agreement.

---

6. Permitted Use of Public‑Safe Materials

Public‑safe HCIP materials may be used for:

- academic research  
- evaluation  
- discussion  
- cross‑system testing  
- standards exploration  

provided that:

- authorship is preserved,  
- attribution is maintained, and  
- no claim is made to the proprietary components of HCIP.

---

7. No Transfer of Proprietary Rights

Publication of public‑safe materials does not constitute:

- a transfer of ownership,  
- a waiver of rights,  
- an open‑source release, or  
- permission to reconstruct or infer proprietary mechanisms.

All proprietary HCIP components remain confidential and protected.

---

8. Statement of Intent

This document serves to:

- establish clear authorship,  
- define the boundaries of public vs. proprietary content,  
- protect the integrity of HCIP as an architecture,  
- preserve the author’s rights for future patent filings, licensing, and commercialization, and  
- ensure that all derivative systems acknowledge HCIP’s origin and ownership.
