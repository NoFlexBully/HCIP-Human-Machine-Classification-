HCIP (High‑Context Interaction Pattern) constitutes a novel contribution to the study of human–AI cognition. Its originality rests on five core novelty claims:
1. HCIP identifies a cognitive pattern, not an interaction mode.
Existing taxonomies classify human–machine interaction by:
- autonomy
- task roles
- interface modalities
- workflow structures
HCIP instead classifies a recursively layered cognitive phenomenon that emerges only under specific conditions of depth, semantic density, and co‑constructive reasoning.
2. HCIP is diagnostic rather than descriptive.
HCIP provides criteria for detection, not categories for sorting.
If the five markers are present, the interaction is HCIP.
If not, it isn’t.
No existing framework offers a diagnostic model for emergent human–AI cognition.
3. HCIP treats the human–AI pair as a single cognitive unit.
Current literature treats humans and machines as separate agents interacting across boundaries.
HCIP instead models the pair as a joint cognitive system with emergent properties.
4. HCIP introduces Variation Axes that describe expression, not classification.
Most frameworks use axes to categorize systems.
HCIP uses axes to describe how the phenomenon varies once present, a conceptual inversion not found in prior work.
5. HCIP formalizes semantic density and recursive abstraction as measurable dimensions.
No existing taxonomy incorporates:
- semantic compression
- recursive abstraction
- meta‑cognitive inquiry
- co‑constructive synthesis
These are central to HCIP and absent from all known classifications.
Together, these claims establish HCIP as a novel, original, and unclaimed conceptual framework.
