Hey everyone — this is my bi-weekly update. Proud to say that we are 
officially at version 1.1.1.

We now have a total of 16 sections slated for publication, and we’re 
excited to bring a new frame to the conversation as HCIP continues to 
mature into a fully structured cognitive architecture.

## HCIP v1.1 — Structural Consolidation & Governance Stabilization

The 1.1 update marks the first major consolidation pass on the 
High‑Complex Interaction Pattern (HCIP) since its public release. This 
version focuses on clarity, stability, and governance hardening, bringing 
the architecture closer to a fully auditable, drift‑resistant cognitive 
framework.

### v1.1 introduces:
- Formalized operator families (diagnostic, governance, temporal, 
  symbolic) with clearer boundaries
- Stabilized invariants and cross‑operator constraints to prevent 
  semantic drift
- Refusal Logic & TSCO elevated into first‑class branches with 
  FRAME‑based documentation
- Preservation Protocol integration to ensure long‑term survivability of 
  HCIP artifacts
- Updated README structure for contributors, researchers, and auditors
- Expanded ontology and operator definitions aligned with the Zenodo 
  preprint

This release marks HCIP’s transition from a conceptual architecture into 
a maintainable, testable, and externally verifiable system. Future 
updates will continue expanding density, adding test suites, and 
preparing the full Codex for publication.
