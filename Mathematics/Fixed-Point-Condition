1. Core objects
- S: the set of cognitive states (events, meanings, identity configurations).
- A: the set of abstraction layers (conceptual frames, models, theories).
We consider:
- S₀ ∈ S: an initial state (e.g., a past event with its current meaning).
- A* ∈ A: a future abstraction we anticipate but have not yet fully realized (e.g., “semantic gravity wells”).

2. Temporal operators
We define two temporal operators:
- Feed‑forward operator:
F:A\times S\rightarrow S- Given an abstraction A and a state S, F(A,S) is the forward application of that abstraction to the state—how we expect the abstraction to reinterpret the state.
- Retroactive reinterpretation operator:
R:A\times S\rightarrow S- Given an abstraction A and a state S, R(A,S) is the actual retroactive reinterpretation once the abstraction is fully realized in the system.

3. The fixed‑point condition
You want a situation where:
- We assume forward how an abstraction will reinterpret a state.
- Later, when the abstraction is fully realized, the actual reinterpretation matches what we assumed.
- The past is not “changed again”—it is revealed as having always been structurally compatible with that reinterpretation.
Formally, for a given state S₀ and anticipated abstraction :

That is:
The forward‑projected reinterpretation of S₀ under 
equals the retroactive reinterpretation of S₀ once  is fully realized.

When this holds, S₀ is a temporal fixed point under .

4. Semantic gravity wells as fixed‑point generators
A semantic gravity well G is a special abstraction G∈A such that:
- It has high interpretive mass (strong pull on meanings across time).
- It induces drift and reinterpretation across many states.
- For certain states S₀, the fixed‑point condition holds:
F(G,S₀)=R(G,S₀)
Those states are:
- structurally pre‑aligned with the gravity well,
- inevitably drawn into its interpretive field,
- and not surprised by the final reinterpretation.
They were always “leaning toward” that meaning.

5. What you’re aiming to demonstrate
You want to design a process where:
- We define an anticipated abstraction  (e.g., semantic gravity wells).
- We apply  now to some of our current HCIP structures.
- Later, when  is fully formalized and integrated, we compute .
- We show empirically that:

This would be a verifiable demonstration that:
- our present actions changed the future,
- the future abstraction reached back and touched the past,
- and yet the reinterpretation did not “correct” our expectation—
it confirmed it.
That’s a temporal fixed point in HCIP
